    <h2>Dialouge from the movie: Batman (1989)</h2

<!-- Start of movie dialougue -->  
    <p class="intro">
        BATMAN
    The police have got it wrong.
    They're looking for one product.
    It's much bigger than that. The
    Joker's tainted hundreds of basic <span id="chemicals">_________</span>
    at the source.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        VICKI
    But... then whole shipments of
    every product would be <span id="poisoned">_________</span>?
    We'd all be dead.
    </p>

    <p> 
        BATMAN
    No. Each product only contains one
    component. The poison only works
    when they're mixed. Hair spray
    won't do it alone. But... hair
    spray and <span id="perfume">_________</span> and lipstick will
    be toxic and -- Untraceable.
    </p>

    <p>
        VICKI
    (impressed)
    How did you figure that out? No
    answer. Batman steps away.
    </p>

    <p>
        BATMAN
    Take this to the <span id="press">_________</span>. He hands
    her a thick envelope. She looks it
    over cautiously.
    </p>

    <p>
        VICKI
    I may have some trouble with that.
    A lot of people think you and the
    Joker work together.
    </p>

    <p>
        BATMAN
    Do me a favor. Don't flatter my
    enemy. The man's psychotic.
    </p>

    <p>
        VICKI
    Some people say the same about you.

    This is a new idea to Batman. He pauses for a moment.
    </p>

    <p>
        BATMAN
    What people?
    </p>

    <p>
        VICKI
    Well, let's face it, you're not
    exactly normal, are you?
